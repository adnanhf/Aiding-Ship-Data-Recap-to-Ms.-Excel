# Data Recap Processing by Using Python

## What I am doing
This is a source code for easing a work of doing recap in Ms. Excel. This code is written to categorize data that has entered a month, then export another Ms. Excel file with addition sheets as a report. By this way, an employee doesn't have to type the report manually.

## Boundary
My code is designed for the harbor's report on a local harbormaster, where the data contains of every ship information that docked at the harbor.

## How does my code work?
(coming soon)
